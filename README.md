# MicroPython-ESP32
This is our current code running on our main ESP32 using MicroPython (Hopefully this time without leaking my Wifi Creds)  
We use [this](https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo) as the MicroPython firmware because of some
really nice Features considering GPIO, I2C and Multitasking.
